# PEPATAC 0.9 post-processing pipeline
# Reference the README for setting up this file.

projectName: DATE_project_name
# If running immediately after PEPATAC, this should be the same as "name" in the
# PEPTAC_config.yaml file

genomeBuild: hg38
# Currently supports hg19, hg38, mm9, mm10.

sampleCutoff: 0.5
# This value is a proportion that is used to determine whether a peak is
# retained for the condition-specific peak sets. See README for more information.

moveOut: FALSE
# Only set to TRUE after the post-processing pipeline has been run successfully!
projectDir: "/proj/fureylab/projects/ATAC_processing"

post-PEPATAC: TRUE
# TRUE is run immediately running after PEPATAC.
# If TRUE, samples should consist of sample numbers.
# If FALSE, samples consist of paths to sample PEPATAC directories.

# This is assuming that these are the names of the directories within "results_pipeline"
samples:
  - 185
  - 187
  - 206
  - 208

# # Conditions order must match the order of the above samples
conditions:
  - CD
  - CD
  - NIBD
  - NIBD

# If processing samples already saved in the data directory, point to the
# sample directory like below.
# samples:
#   - /proj/fureylab/data/ATAC/human/colon_tissue/CD_uninflamed/185
#   - /proj/fureylab/data/ATAC/human/colon_tissue/CD_uninflamed/187
#   - /proj/fureylab/data/ATAC/human/colon_tissue/nonIBD/206
